# Topic

A topic is an abstract concept described by a sorted list of words that represents a research area or subject in a domain. The order means the relevance of the word in the topic. 

It contains the following information: 
* **uri**: the Uniform Resource Identifier created by the system to uniquely identify it. 
* **creation-time**:  date  on  which  this  resource  was  created.  It  must  be  a  formatted  timestamp  following [ISO-8601](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm). 
* **content**: an account of the meaning of the topic. Usually, it is the top 15 relevant words. 

Furthermore, a topic mentions one or more words and emerges in only one domain. In turn, a word can be mentioned by zero or more topics and a domain can contain zero or more topics.
