# Part
A part is a logical section in an item. When an item is the textual content of a paper, for instance, it will have as parts the rhetorical classes identified in the sentences of its content. 

It contains the following  information: 
* **uri**: the Uniform Resource Identifier created by the system to uniquely identify it. 
* **creation-time**:  date  on  which  this  resource  was  created.  It  must  be  a  formatted  timestamp  following [ISO-8601](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm). 
* **sense**: It could be a rhetorical class such as *background*, *approach*, *challenge*, *future-work* or *outcome*; or a section in the text such as *introduction*, *abstract*, *discussion*, *conclusion*, *results* or *method*; or any other label used to classify parts of an item. 
* **content**:  text retrieved from the item, sharing the same class in a classification (e.g.rhetorical class).
