# Introduction
**Librairy** is a services-based platform designed specifically using open-source java libraries. The aim of this framework is to allow researchers to easily use semantic techniques as collections of services. Thus, they can reuse them in their deployments or even incorporate new services to share with other researchers. 

All services are developed using the [Boot](https://github.com/librairy/boot) library. It encapsulates all the particularities required by the system, offering a more friendly interface. Also, a Restful-HTTP service is available supporting similar functionality in a less coupled way. It is the [Explorer](https://github.com/librairy/explorer) service.
