## Librairy

**Librairy** is a service-oriented platform that aims to simplify the construction of large scale text-analyzers. It is a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, machine learning algorithms and semantic techniques distributed as services to compose a combined solution. It allows researchers to easily use these services, so that they can reuse them in their deployments or even incorporate new services to share with other researchers. 

All services have been built by using the [Boot](https://github.com/librairy/boot) library. It encapsulates all the particularities required by the system, offering a more friendly interface. Also, a Restful-HTTP service is available supporting similar functionality in a less coupled way. It is the [Explorer](https://github.com/librairy/explorer) service.
