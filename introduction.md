# Introduction
**Librairy** is a plug-in based platform designed specifically using open-source java libraries. The aim of this framework is to allow researchers to easily deploy Semantic Techniques as collections of existing plug-ins. Thus, they can reuse them in their deployments or even incorporate new services to share with other researches. 

All plug-ins are developed by using the [Boot](https://github.com/librairy/boot) library. It encapsulates all the particularities required by the system, offering a more friendly facade.
